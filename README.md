### Introduction
USAA (United Services Automobile Association) provides financial services to its members, including banking, insurance, and investment products. Accurate financial forecasting is crucial for strategic planning, risk management, and ensuring the long-term financial health of the organization. This business case outlines the need for a financial forecasting model that incorporates gearing ratios to predict future financial performance and inform decision-making.

### Business Case for Forecasting

1. **Projected Financial Statements**: Forecasted income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for the next 5 years.
2. **Gearing Ratio Analysis**: Predicted gearing ratios and their impact on financial stability and risk.
3. **Scenario Analysis**: Different scenarios based on varying levels of debt and equity to understand their impact on financial performance and risk.

### Goals and How Forecasting Helps Achieve Them
